# ryanize-bib

Ryanize bib file:
- check that URLs are included
- check that important capital letters are protected
- discourage arXiv and publisher usage
- multi-line entries (i.e. author list split across multiple lines)

Try it at [vilda.net/s/ryanize-bib/](https://vilda.net/s/ryanize-bib/).

What's not working:
- even slightly nonstandard BibTeX formatting
- anything that you'll find, in which case file an issue here and ideally submit a PR
